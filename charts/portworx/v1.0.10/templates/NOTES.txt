Depending on your network and cluster performance, it may take between 5 and 20 minutes to install Portworx. Once the installation is completed, the Portworx processes will be shown as green.

Portworx would create a unified pool of the disks attached to your Kubernetes nodes. No further action should be required and you are ready to consume Portworx Volumes as part of your application data requirements.

For further information on usage of the Portworx, refer to following doc pages.

If pods remain in unavailable state, check the pod events to see all Kubernetes events related to the selected pod:

* Go to portworx in Workloads section
* Then click on the unavailable pod
* Expand the Events section

Or run the following command in terminal:

`
kubectl get events -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} --field-selector involvedObject.kind=Pod | grep portworx*
